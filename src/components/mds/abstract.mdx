# Abstract

The exponential expansion of context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked capabilities for long-document understanding but introduced severe bottlenecks in inference latency and information utilization. Existing compression methods often suffer from high training costs or semantic fragmentation due to aggressive token pruning. 

In this paper, we propose BEAVER, a novel training-free framework that shifts the compression method from linear token removal to structure-aware hierarchical selection.BEAVER maximizes hardware parallelism by mapping variable-length contexts into dense page-level tensors and preserves discourse integrity through a hybrid planner that synergizes dual-path pooling with sentence-level smoothing. 

Extensive evaluations on LongBench, ZeroSCROLLS, RULER, and L-Eval demonstrate that BEAVER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-based methods like LongLLMLingua. Notably, on the challenging RULER benchmark, BEAVER maintains highfidelity in multi-needle retrieval tasks where baselines deteriorate significantly. Efficiency-wise, BEAVER reduces compression latencyby approximately 26× compared to LongLLMLingua on 128k contexts, offering a robust, scalable solution for high-throughput applications.
